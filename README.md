# CUSTOM MINI-SHOP: VUE-JS
This is a follow-up of the Symfony-4 based Micro-Shop Demo. This Vue Micro-App uses Component-Oriented Design 
with REST to build the View Layer.


## INSTALLATION + USAGE HINTS
Simply run `npm install` on the cloned package.
Once NPM finishes installing all the necessary Dependencies, run `npm run serve`
That's all! Afterwards, you may want to navigate to `http://localhost:8080` - assuming that port is Free.
